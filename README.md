# SQL-Database-Management-Project
## Intro
This Project undertakes the task of creating a Database for a library using SQL.
## Data Collection
Data for this projected were made available after collection by the staff of the Library. 
The data were various tables that were stored in CSV files. The tables include detailed records of books, Staff records, issued book records and more.
## Project Task
The library had requests for certain information to be added or deleted from the database.  Records that fulfilled certain conditions were also requested.

Process 
The project started by first creating the database and adding tables to contain the data provided in the CSV.
This was done using POSTGRES SQL. 

Queries were then run to excecute the tasks communicated and  answer all of the questions raised by the management of the Library.
